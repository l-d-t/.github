# Open Source

We’ve recently started sharing some of our open-source work, and we’re eager to continue growing in this area. We’d love to do even more open-source projects in the future, and your support will help make that possible.

You can support us in the following ways:

- **Work with Us**: We offer B2B services like development and consulting through [LDT](https://ldt.hr/), as well as white-label collaborations. By working with us, you’ll not only receive professional services but also help indirectly support our open-source efforts.

- **Donate**: Your contributions will help us dedicate more time and resources to open-source development.

Your support will enable us to do more open-source in the future. Thank you!
